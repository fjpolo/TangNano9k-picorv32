This directory contains a tiny and simple C program that runs on the
picorv32 core on the simple SoC.

The build process is very limited.  See the Makefile.  It creates
file mem_init.v which is to be included in the Verilog build and
initializes the sram (to contain a simple program).

Don't use any global variables or standard library functions.  Only
the .text section is handled.  There are no checks for running
beyond memory.

You will need the gcc cross compiler for riscv.  On Ubuntu 22.04,

sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf

Basically, "make" and be sure mem_init.v gets included in sram.v

Sorry this is not more complete...

Hint:

   riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d prog

will disassemble the code.

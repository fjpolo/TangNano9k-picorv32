This directory contains a simple SoC that uses the risc-v (32-bit)
core from https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32.  File picorv32.v
is from there.

The project targets the Tang Nano 9K FPGA development board that
contains a Gowin GW1NR-9LV FPGA.  It is intended to be very
simple.

It was built using the educational version of the Gowin IDE and
tool chain, 1.9.9 Beta-4 Education Build(68283).

The Gowin IDE should build it.  See the README in directory c_code for
information on how to build the software.  The program already in
mem_init.v causes the LEDs on the board to count.  S1 is the reset
button.

It contains only an SRAM and an LED target.  The SRAM is initialized by
the Verilog build process.  This is how the software is "loaded".
